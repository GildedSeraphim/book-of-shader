My work progressing through the book "The Book of Shaders"

Some notes::
 - I am only learning shaders with this not full pipeline so I am using the glslViewer tool to see any changes that I have made.
 - My final goal is to make a path shader in vulkan. This statement is here so I have a clear goal to work towards.
 - Other resources I intend to use can be found in my repo of resources.
